<p>My Name is Conor Watson, Iâ€™m 23 years old and have a first-class degree in Computer Science from Plymouth University And currently work for BAE Systems Applied Intelligence working as a software developer on a range of technologies.</p>
<p>During my time at university, I took a sandwich year at BAE Systems Applied Intelligence where I worked on integrating an open-source NoSQL database with the existing system. During my placement I was offered a full-time position in the team, I have been there since working on an ever ranging technology stack.</p>
<p>This blog is to provide resources to help people who are transitioning from A university style of working and writing software into a professional environment. I will try to post about techniques, ways of thinking and even just general tips that are missed from university syllabuses that are used all the time in the day to day life of a software developer.</p>
